# PRANK CALL BOT

A Flask-based application that acts as an automated prank bot. The application leverages Twilio's Voice API to receive and process incoming calls, OpenAI's Whisper ASR API to transcribe speech, GPT-3.5 Turbo to generate responses, and Eleven Labs' TTS API to convert text to speech.

## Prerequisites

1. Python 3.6 or higher
2. Flask
3. Twilio SDK
4. OpenAI SDK
5. A Twilio account with a valid phone number
6. An OpenAI API key
7. An Eleven Labs API key

## Installation
Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Set up environment variables for your API keys and Eleven Labs Voice ID:
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_key"
export ELEVENLABS_API_KEY="your_elevenlabs_key"
export ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID="your_voice_id"

Run the Flask app:
python app.py

Important: Configure your Twilio webhook to point to your running application's /incoming_call endpoint.

## Usage
Call your Twilio phone number.
The automated survey bot will ask questions about politics.
The bot will use GPT-3 to generate probing follow-up questions based on your answers.
